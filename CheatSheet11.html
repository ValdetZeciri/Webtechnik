    <h2><b>1) 3 Essential Technology:</b></h2>
    <br /> a system of globally unique identifiers for resources on the Web and elsewhere, the uniform resource locator (URL) and uniform resource identifier (URI);
    <br /> the publishing language Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)
    <br /> the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
    <br /> The first web site which described the project itself, was published on 20 December 1990.(Tom Berners Lee,Robert Cailliau )
    <br />

    <br /> <h2> <b>2)URL=</b>Uniform Resource Locator </h2>
    <br /> A Uniform Resource Locator (URL), colloquially termed a web address, is a reference to a web resource that specifies its location on a computer network and a mechanism for retrieving it.
    <br /> Most web browsers display the URL of a web page above the page in an address bar. A typical URL could have the form http://www.example.com/index.html, which indicates a protocol (http), a hostname (www.example.com), and a file name (index.html).
    <br />

    <br /> <h2><b>3) Web Server:</b></h2>
    <br /> A web server is server software, or hardware dedicated to running this software, that can satisfy client requests on the World Wide Web. A web server can, in general, contain one or more websites.
    <br /> Function:to store, process and deliver web pages to clients.
    <br /> The communication between client and server takes place using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
    <br />

    <br /> <h2><b>4)Web Browser:</b></h2>Is a software application for accessing information on the World Wide Web.
    <br /> Purpose: To fetch information resources from the Web and display them on a user's device.
    <br /> Function: Process begins when the user inputs a Uniform Resource Locator (URL), into the browser.Most browsers use an internal cache of web page resources to improve loading times for subsequent visits to the same page.
    The cache can store many items.
    <br />

    <br /><h2><b> Doctype:</b></h2>It is an "information" to the browser about what document type to expect.The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is NOT case sensitive.
    <br />

    <br /><h2><b>Body:</b></h2> The body tag defines the document's body.The body element contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks. 1 Body Element.
    <br />

    <br /><h2><b> EM:</b></h2>used to define emphasized text. The content inside is typically displayed in italic. A screen reader will pronounce the words in em with an emphasis, using verbal stress.(em)
    <br />

    <br /><h2><b> Head:</b> </h2>A container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the Doctype and the body.
    <br /> Metadata: Metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed. It typically define the document title, character set, styles, scripts, and other meta information.
    <br />style, base, link meta, script, noscript can be in the Head.
    <br />

    <br /> <h2><b>HTML:</b></h2>represents the root of an HTML document. Is the container for all other HTML elements (except for the <!DOCTYPE> tag).
    <br />You should always include the lang attribute inside the HTML, to declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.
    <br />

    <br /><b> Strong:</b> Is used to define text with strong importance. The content inside is typically displayed in bold. < b>
    <br />

    <br /><b>Title:</b>defines the title of the document. Text-Only, and it is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab.
    <br />1)defines a title in the browser toolbar 2) provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites 3) displays a title for the page in search-engine results

    <br /><b>WWW</b>
    <br />1)What are the most essential technologies that made the World Wide Web such a success?
    <br /> 1) a system of globally unique identifiers for resources on the Web and elsewhere, the uniform resource locator (URL) and uniform resource identifier (URI);2) the publishing language Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)3) the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
    <br />2)How are resources (html pages, images, etc) addressed in the web?
    <br />Answer: They are adressed with Urls.
    <br />3)What are the general components of a url?

    <br /><b>Web Server</b>
    <br />1)What is a web server?
    <br />A web server is server software, or hardware dedicated to running this software, that can satisfy client requests on the World Wide Web.

    <br />The communication between client and server takes place using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Pages delivered are most frequently HTML documents, which may include images, style sheets and scripts in addition to the text content.
    <br />A user agent, commonly a web browser or web crawler, initiates communication by making a request for a specific resource using HTTP and the server responds with the content of that resource or an error message if unable to do so. The resource is typically a real file on the server's secondary storage, but this is not necessarily the case and depends on how the web server is implemented.
