    <h2><b>1) 3 Essential Technology:</b></h2>
    <br /> a system of globally unique identifiers for resources on the Web and elsewhere, the uniform resource locator (URL) and uniform resource identifier (URI);
    <br /> the publishing language Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)
    <br /> the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
    <br /> The first web site which described the project itself, was published on 20 December 1990.(Tom Berners Lee,Robert Cailliau )
    <br />

    <br /> <h2> <b>2)URL=</b>Uniform Resource Locator </h2>
    <br /> A Uniform Resource Locator (URL), colloquially termed a web address, is a reference to a web resource that specifies its location on a computer network and a mechanism for retrieving it.
    <br /> Most web browsers display the URL of a web page above the page in an address bar. A typical URL could have the form http://www.example.com/index.html, which indicates a protocol (http), a hostname (www.example.com), and a file name (index.html).
    <br />

    <br /> <h2><b>3) Web Server:</b></h2>
    <br /> A web server is server software, or hardware dedicated to running this software, that can satisfy client requests on the World Wide Web. A web server can, in general, contain one or more websites.
    <br /> Function:to store, process and deliver web pages to clients.
    <br /> The communication between client and server takes place using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
    <br />

    <br /> <h2><b>4)Web Browser:</b></h2>Is a software application for accessing information on the World Wide Web.
    <br /> Purpose: To fetch information resources from the Web and display them on a user's device.
    <br /> Function: Process begins when the user inputs a Uniform Resource Locator (URL), into the browser.Most browsers use an internal cache of web page resources to improve loading times for subsequent visits to the same page.
    The cache can store many items.
    <br />

    <br /><h2><b> Doctype:</b></h2>It is an "information" to the browser about what document type to expect.The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is NOT case sensitive.
    <br />

    <br /><h2><b>Body:</b></h2> The body tag defines the document's body.The body element contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks. 1 Body Element.
    <br />

    <br /><h2><b> EM:</b></h2>used to define emphasized text. The content inside is typically displayed in italic. A screen reader will pronounce the words in em with an emphasis, using verbal stress.(em)
    <br />

    <br /><h2><b> Head:</b> </h2>A container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the Doctype and the body.
    <br /> Metadata: Metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed. It typically define the document title, character set, styles, scripts, and other meta information.
    <br />style, base, link meta, script, noscript can be in the Head.
    <br />

    <br /> <h2><b>HTML:</b></h2>represents the root of an HTML document. Is the container for all other HTML elements (except for the <!DOCTYPE> tag).
    <br />You should always include the lang attribute inside the HTML, to declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.
    <br />

    <br /><b> Strong:</b> Is used to define text with strong importance. The content inside is typically displayed in bold. < b>
    <br />

    <br /><b>Title:</b>defines the title of the document. Text-Only, and it is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab.
    <br />1)defines a title in the browser toolbar 2) provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites 3) displays a title for the page in search-engine results

    <br /><b>Questions of the first week:</b>
    <br /><b>WWW</b>
    <br />1)What are the most essential technologies that made the World Wide Web such a success?
    <br /> 1) a system of globally unique identifiers for resources on the Web and elsewhere, the uniform resource locator (URL) and uniform resource identifier (URI);2) the publishing language Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)3) the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
    <br />2)How are resources (html pages, images, etc) addressed in the web?
    <br />Answer: They are adressed with Urls.
    <br />3)What are the general components of a url?
    <br />a protocol (http), a hostname (www.example.com) and a file name (index.html).
    <br />

    <br /><b>Web Server</b>
    <br />1)What is a web server?
    <br />A web server is server software, or hardware dedicated to running this software, that can satisfy client requests on the World Wide Web.
    <br />2)What does a Web Server?
    <br />He contain one or more websites. He stores, process and deliver web pages to clients.A web server processes incoming network requests over HTTP and several other related protocols. The primary function of a web server is to store, process and deliver web pages to clients.
    <br />3)How can content be stored on a web server?
    <br />The communication between client and server takes place using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Pages delivered are most frequently HTML documents, which may include images, style sheets and scripts in addition to the text content.
    <br />A user agent, commonly a web browser or web crawler, initiates communication by making a request for a specific resource using HTTP and the server responds with the content of that resource or an error message if unable to do so. The resource is typically a real file on the server's secondary storage, but this is not necessarily the case and depends on how the web server is implemented.
    <br />4)How is content in webpages desribed?
    <br />Web content is the textual, visual, or aural content that is encountered as part of the user experience on websites. It may include—among other things—text, images, sounds, videos, and animations.
    <br />

    <br /><b>Web Client</b>
    <br />1)What is a web client?
    <br />Is a software application for accessing information on the World Wide Web.
    <br />2) What does a web client?
    <br />To fetch information resources from the Web and display them on a user's device.
    <br />3)Web Client and Web Browser is the same
    <br /> Yes they are the same, because they accessed information on the World Wide Web.The client sends requests for web document or service. ... Web Browser is an Application program that displays a World wide web document. It usually uses the internet service to access the document.
    <br />

    <br /><b>Hello World</b>
    <br />1)What is the html head element?
    <br /> Is a container for Metadata. It define the document title, styles, character set, sripts and other informations.
    <br />2)What does <!DOCTYPE` html> mean?

    <h1>Questions of the second week:</h1>
    <h1>1)Name the components of html elements properly:</h1>
    <br />An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag.The HTML document itself begins with < html> and ends with < /html>.
    <br />The visible part of the HTML document is between < body> and < /body>.


    <h1>2)Identify void elements and how they are denoted:</h1>
    <br /> Void Elements dont have an end tag. Empty Elements (< br />)
    <br />

    <h1><b>3)Identify attributes:</b></h1>
    <br />All HTML elements can have <b>attributes</b>
    <br />Attributes provide <b>additional information</b> about elements
    <br />Attributes are always specified in <b>the start tag</b>
    <br />Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: <b>name="value"</b>

    <p>The href Attribute: The < a> tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to:</p>

    <p>The src Attribute:The < img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed:< img src="img_girl.jpg"></p>
    <p>There are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute:1. Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website. Example: src= "https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg".</p>
    <p>2. Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not include the domain name. If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page. Example: src="img_girl.jpg". If the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain. Example: src="/images/img_girl.jpg".</p>
    <p>Tip: It is almost always best to use relative URLs. They will not break if you change domain.</p>

    <p>The width and height Attributes:The < img> tag should also contain the width and height attributes, which specifies the width and height of the image (in pixels):< img src="img_girl.jpg" width="500" height="600"></p>

    <p>The alt Attribute:The required alt attribute for the <img> tag specifies an alternate text for an image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed. This can be due to slow connection, or an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader.(< img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl with a jacket")></p>

    <p>The style Attribute:The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.(< p style="color:red;">This is a red paragraph.< /p>)</p>

    <p>The lang Attribute:You should always include the lang attribute inside the < html> tag, to declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.</p>
    <p>The title Attribute:The title attribute defines some extra information about an element.(< p title="I'm a tooltip">This is a paragraph.</p>


    <br /><b>>All HTML elements can have attributes</b>

    <br />< a > specifies the URL of the page the link goes to

    <br />The src attribute of < img> specifies the path to the image to be displayed

    <br />The width and height attributes of < img> provide size information for images

    <br />The alt attribute of < img> provides an alternate text for an image

    <br />The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more

    <br />The lang attribute of the < html> tag declares the language of the Web page

    <br />The title attribute defines some extra information about an element



    <h1>4)Write down the correct DOCTYPE declaration for html 5</h1>
    <br />< !DOCTYPE html> The < !DOCTYPE> declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.
    <br />

    <p><b>HTML Paragraphs:</b>HTML paragraphs are defined with the < p> tag:< p>This is a paragraph.< /p></p>
    <p><b>HTML Images:</b>HTML images are defined with the < img> tag.The source file (src), alternative text (alt), width, and height are provided as attributes:< img src="w3schools.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com" width="104" height="142"></p>
    <p>The < img> tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.</p>
    <p><b>Images in Another Folder:If you have your images in a sub-folder, you must include the folder name in the src attribute(< img src="/images/html5.gif" alt="HTML5 Icon" style="width:128px;height:128px;"></b></p>
    <p><b>Images on Another Server/Website:</b>Some web sites points to an external image on another server.To point to an image on another server, you must specify an absolute (full) URL in the src attribute:< img src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/w3schools_green.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com"></p>

    <p>HTML Elements:An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag:< h1 Start Tag >My First Heading Content < /h1 Endtag> </p>
    <p> Some HTML elements have no content (like the < br> element). These elements are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag!</p>
    <p>Nested HTML Elements:HTML elements can be nested (this means that elements can contain other elements).</p>
    <p>Empty HTML Elements(Void Elemnts):HTML elements with no content are called empty elements.The < br> tag defines a line break, and is an empty element without a closing tag:</p>
    <p>HTML is Not Case Sensitive</p>
    <p>HTML tags are not case sensitive: < P> means the same as < p>.</p>

    <br />

    <h1>10.Identify the difference between serif and sans-serif fonts:</h1>
    <br />Serif:Serif fonts have small lines at the ends on some characters(Times New Roman,Georgia)
    <br />Sans-serif:"Sans" means without - these fonts do not have the lines at the ends of characters(Arial)
    <br />

    <h1>11.Declarations for font families:</h1>The font-family property should hold several font names as a "fallback" system. Start with the font you want, and end with a generic family, to let the browser pick a similar font in the generic family, if no other fonts are available.(font-family: "Times New Roman", Times, serif;)

    <h1>13.Declarations for font sizes:</h1>The font-size property sets the size of the text.(h1{font-size: 40px;})
    <br />Absolute size:Sets the text to a specified size,Does not allow a user to change the text size in all browsers (bad for accessibility reasons),Absolute size is useful when the physical size of the output is known
    <br />Relative Size:Sets the size relative to surrounding elements,Allows a user to change the text size in browsers
    <br />
    <p>Setting the text size with pixels gives you full control over the text size:(< h1>font-size: 40px;< /h1></p>
    <p>
        To allow users to resize the text (in the browser menu), many developers use em instead of pixels.The em size unit is recommended by the W3C.1em is equal to the current font size. The default text size in browsers is 16px. So, the default size of 1em is 16px.
    </p>
